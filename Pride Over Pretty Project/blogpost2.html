The bright lights, the innumerable fans, the numerous awards, the glamorous red carpets, the fame--all with a terrifying price. The #Time’s Up movement sparked unprecedented conversations and exposed the underlying and silenced abuse of power that defined the Hollywood industry as a whole. With popular icons revealing their stories of sexual abuse, the movement conquered headlines everywhere, encouraging women all over the world to speak up about  their stories. Numerous events have occurred where women have been objectified by the media, regardless of age. Women have been subject to derogatory terms used by the public and within their own spheres due to the prevalent sexist and gender-biased mindsets. For those who are unaware of the #MeToo movement and the #Time’s Up movement that followed, here is a brief summary: These movements exposed the abuse women faced in different industries, starting with Hollywood. The main issues surrounded Harvey Weinstein, who acted inappropriately to several women, misusing his power and exploiting talented actresses. To silence these incidents, he forced them to sign various agreements; in an article by Vox, “7 Positive Changes that have come from the #MeToo Movement,” it is stated that, “...Zelda Perkins, Weinstein’s former assistant, signed an agreement as part of a settlement that prevented her from telling even family members that Weinstein had exposed himself to her repeatedly, including forcing her to take dictation while he bathed.” He forced these women to feel powerless, pushing them into submission and enacting his power over them. This same scenario has been reflected in the stories of other women who worked alongside him. These stories of abuse span far greater than Hollywood; according to the Harvard Business Review, “Sixty three percent of women reported having harassed, with 33% experiencing it more than once.” With dreams, passions, ambitions--these women are welcomed with perverted eyes and abusive natures. Social media has been a huge tool to share these stories and bring greater awareness to these issues. Since the movements, thousands of cases have been reported to the Legal Defense Fund, encouraging others to be courageous and indignant. These movements have brought to other issues in Hollywood regarding the lack of representation women have in categories behind the scenes such as direction. These movements have been critical to the advancement of women worldwide, and even one girl’s success can evoke hope in every girl’s dreams.
