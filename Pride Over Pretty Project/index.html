       <h1>What is Pride over Pretty?</h1>
            <p>The future is female is nothing less than a fact; women have slowly and unprecedentedly attained positions in a diverse set of fields, implementing impactful changes and improvements to our societies. The Pride over Pretty Project aims to highlight the success stories of women in different industries in hope to inspire young girls who wish to pursue similar careers. Our events include interviews with professional, working women; these discussions focus on sharing the diverse experiences women have undergone as well as exploring their passions and goals. We will also hold fundraisers to donate money to organizations that fight for equal pay and other nonprofits that work to provide education to girls in underprivileged countries. We hope that through this project, we can contribute to the growing generations of young and intelligent girls.  </p>
