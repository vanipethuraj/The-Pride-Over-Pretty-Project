        <p>Business has slowly become a rising pursuit for women and young girls worldwide. Business has proven to be a catalyst for individuals to explore and enhance their skills of entrepreneurship and communication while also making their way to stock markets and other competitive outlets. However, women face struggles when attempting to make the best of their careers in the business industry; similar to many other fields, they face an ongoing battle to receive treatment that is equivalent to their male counterparts. 
Primarily, equal pay; this is an issue that has been prevalent for centuries--but still unsolved. Personally, I find this issue absurd as I cannot imagine the justifications that are put forth when paying a woman less than a man for the same occupation. It is appalling to see that this issue is still present in our country and peeving that it is worse in foreign economies. Christina Carosella, a member of the Forbes Council and the CEO of the business honors society, Beta Gamma Sigma, highlights the struggles she faced as a young corporate employee that were based solely on her presence as a female. She explains how she made less money than the three men who worked alongside her; when confronting her boss, “he [the boss] said the guys had wives and families to support, and that I didn’t need as much money because I was single without children” (Corasella). This is a mere example of the excuses given to women in regards to the pay gap; salaries should be based on the quality of work, the ability of the staff to accomplish their goals and bring advancement to the companies--not gender. According to the United States Census Bureau, they found that in 2018, women earned 81 cents for every dollar a man did; this gap is even larger for women of color. 
Another issue regarding women in business is promotions--why do men receive more promotions in comparison to women? There is no valid answer to the question of why--there are only excuses rooted in discrmination and institutionalized sexism. In a CNN Business article written by Marianne Cooper, a research scholar at Stanford university, she states that, “For every 100 men that are promoted and hired to manager, only 72 women are promoted and hired. This disparity means that men end up holding 62% of manager-level positions, while women hold 38%” (Cooper). With less women in manager-level positions, this pattern of gender inequality becomes a repetitive cycle that discourages intelligent women who wish to seek better opportunities in the field. This cycle rests on a broken system layered with misbeliefs and gender-bias, one that must end to foster the creative minds that define the coming generations of  young women. 
            The struggles that women face can not be encapsulated in a few sentences nor can they be ended in a few minutes; gender-bias is rooted in the mind, abated in households. It is an issue that needs to be tackled in every aspect of life:from soccer fields to Wall-street. It is an issue that requires immediate attention and assistance.
