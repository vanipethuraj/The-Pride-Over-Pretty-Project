       <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>Two girls, apprehensively excited about their futures as adults, decided to create the Pride over Pretty Project to build a platform where women from a diverse set of workplaces could share their stories and struggles. All our proceeds go directly to funding causes which fight for the advancement of women in the workplace as well as the education of girls in underprivileged countries.</p>

She has never really found herself interested in social change issues prior to this project but has recently become exposed to the prevalent and ongoing gender bias problems in the workplace. Vani strongly believes that this difficulty must be addressed and receive awareness.</p>
